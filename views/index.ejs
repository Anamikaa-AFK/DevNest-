            <h2>Our Friday sessions turn practice into a weekly ritual</h2>
            <p class="para3" style="text-align: left;">Every Friday, we meet to tackle a new problem. You'll independently develop solutions, which are then meticulously critiqued by both peers and faculty. This is a whole new way of practice that's unique to our program. The weekly cadence allows you to make deliberate practice a consistent part of your routine.</p>

Our overarching goal is for you to feel confident that you can turn any idea into reality.</p>

                <span style="background-color: bisque;">Due to the self-paced nature and mastery-based assessments, duration to some goal (e.g. career change, more competitive role) varies wildly.</span> It depends on many factors like your ability, effort, goals, educational background, and the hiring market.
                There is absolutely intense sales pressure to market very short, unrealistic timelines accompanied by fudged success rates. Not only is this dishonest, but it's counterproductive because it pushes students to cut corners.
                As part of the admissions interview, we're happy to provide an estimate based on your performance and background. For admitted students, we can provide better estimates that incorporate evidence from assessments, live sessions, and interview post-mortems.
